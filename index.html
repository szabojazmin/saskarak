        <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>        
        <p>Mantis shrimps are predators which kill their prey by hitting them at high speed. 
           They have large complex eyes and are highly coloured.</p>

        <h2>Attack</h2>
        <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong>spearers</strong> or <strong>smashers</strong>.</p>
        <p>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey, and can cause 
            serious damage on victims larger than themselves.</p>
        <h2>Eyesight</h2>
        <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each 
            other. They are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. </p>
        <p>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light, and 
            color vision outside the normal visual spectrum.</p>
